# Tailwind CSS: Non-Existent or Misspelled Classes Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Tailwind CSS: using classes that don't exist or are misspelled in your project.  This can lead to unexpected styling or no styling at all. The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect code and `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Make sure you have Tailwind CSS correctly installed and configured. 
2. Use the code in `bug.js` in your project.
3. Observe the unexpected styling (or lack of). 
4. Use the code in `bugSolution.js` as a corrected example.

**Solution:**
Carefully check the spelling of your Tailwind CSS classes. Refer to your Tailwind configuration and documentation to verify the existence and correct spelling of your classes.
